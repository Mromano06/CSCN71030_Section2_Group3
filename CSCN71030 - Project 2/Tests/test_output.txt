You wake up in the middle of the woods, with your head pounding.
The damp earth clings to your clothes, and the scent of pine and decay lingers in the air.
Shadows stretch between the trees as a cold breeze cuts through the silence.
Your body aches, but nothing seems broken. Your weapons and supplies are gone, but your gear remains.
It's as if someone wanted you alive, but defenseless...
You have no memory of how you got here. 
Through the trees to your right, you see the distant glow of lanterns.
It is a small village, quiet but eerily familiar.
To your left, the woods grow darker and denser, the path uncertain.
Which way do you go?
(1) To the forest! or (2) To the Village: Enter your choice (1-2): No turning back now. Your adventure begins!
